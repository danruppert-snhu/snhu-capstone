# Professional Self-Assessment

Throughout my academic journey in the Computer Science program, the capstone experience and the development of my ePortfolio served not only as a culminating project but also as a meaningful opportunity to showcase the full range of my professional strengths. The structure of the capstone course, with its emphasis on reviewing, enhancing, and reflecting on prior work, enabled me to intentionally integrate software engineering principles, algorithmic reasoning, and database design into a cohesive and demonstrable body of work. The ePortfolio highlights not just completed assignments, but a record of measurable growth, technical mastery, and architectural decision-making grounded in practical development scenarios.

Throughout my studies, I completed coursework that deepened my understanding of data structures and algorithms, beginning with their mathematical foundations and expanding into their practical applications in software. My exposure to a wide range of database technologies included relational models, NoSQL systems, and tools for data visualization and analysis, such as Jupyter. I studied programming languages across procedural, functional, and object-oriented paradigms, allowing me to understand not only syntax but also the design philosophies that guide language selection and optimization. This foundational knowledge has shaped how I approach problem-solving, evaluate trade-offs, and maintain robust systems.

At the same time, I was advancing in my professional career. This dual path gave me the rare opportunity to apply new concepts in real time and solidify them through direct experience. While many professionals become siloed in narrow focus areas such as system administration, CI/CD, or feature implementation, I’ve actively bridged those gaps. My work has helped unify teams and guide architectural decisions for multiple companies, often through a blend of consultative support and active engineering contributions.

Though my capstone was a solo initiative, my work centered around several core competencies: team collaboration, communication with stakeholders, data structures and algorithms, software engineering, database design, and security. Collaboration was integrated into my workflow through version control using Git and GitHub. I used meaningful commit messages and organized change history, which supports team scalability even in single-developer scenarios. Stakeholder communication was demonstrated through structured checkpoint reports and iterative improvements based on instructor feedback. These practices mirror real-world agile development cycles.

Data structures and algorithms were critical in implementing LRU caching, recurrence logic, and event sorting. My database design included a secure, normalized SQLite implementation with referential integrity and input validation. I applied encryption and parameterized queries to mitigate common security risks. Security was also addressed through encapsulation, abstraction, and adherence to best practices for mobile data persistence. Software engineering tied all these efforts together, governing the structure and extensibility of the application and supporting everything under the hood of the final deliverables.

A key component of the ePortfolio is the informal code review I created early in the capstone. This walkthrough acted as both a planning tool and a self-evaluation. It provided a structured explanation of my code, identified areas for enhancement, and outlined a roadmap for improvement. The video format allowed me to clearly communicate design goals and reasoning, reinforcing my ability to present technical decisions to peers and future collaborators.

My enhancements were divided across three major categories: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. Within Software Design and Engineering, I improved modularity, implemented persistent session management, and added structured exception handling. For Algorithms and Data Structures, I incorporated an LRU cache, optimized sorting and scheduling logic, and used enums for more elegant recurrence control. In the Databases category, I restructured schemas, added foreign key constraints and indexes, and implemented transaction-safe inserts with parameterized queries to enhance both efficiency and security.

Together, these enhancements reflect a comprehensive understanding of scalable application design. I worked across the entire stack, not just improving individual components but also focusing on how those components interact, scale, and evolve. Each decision was made with a clear purpose—prioritizing usability, performance, and maintainability.

What truly sets my ePortfolio apart is not just the quality of the technical work, but the story it tells. I documented my thought process, identified the problems I solved, and reflected on what I learned. This narrative provides insight into how I approach real-world computing challenges with precision, clarity, and intent. Whether viewing my source code, watching my code review, or reading my reflection, any prospective employer will see a candidate who builds systems with both skill and foresight—and who continuously strives to grow.
