# Welcome to My Computer Science Capstone Portfolio

Hi, I’m Daniel Ruppert — a passionate infrastructure architect and software developer with a strong background in cloud architecture, systems design, and full-stack development. This portfolio showcases the culmination of my work in Southern New Hampshire University’s Computer Science program, highlighting key enhancements made to a real-world Android application as part of my CS-499 capstone.

## 📄 [Professional Self-Assessment](self-assessment/index.md)

My self-assessment reflects on the skills I’ve gained throughout the program and how I’ve applied them in real-world technical scenarios, along with insights into my career path and personal growth.

---

## 🔍 Code Review

Before completing my enhancements, I performed a [code review walkthrough](code-review/index.md) where I assessed the project’s initial state and discussed my plan to address structural, algorithmic, and security improvements.

## 🚀 Capstone Enhancements

The following enhancements are organized into the three primary competency areas of computer science:

- ### 🛠 [Software Design & Engineering](enhancements/software-engineering/index.md)
  Focused on modularity, maintainability, session persistence, and code clarity.

- ### 📊 [Algorithms & Data Structures](enhancements/software-engineering/index.md)
  Covered performance optimization, recurrence logic, LRU caching, and event sorting.

- ### 🗄 [Databases](enhancements/databases/index.md)
  Involved schema refactoring, SQL injection protection, referential integrity, and secure password storage.
